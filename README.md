# Learning Rust with Raytracer in one weekend

I suspect that it will take more than a weekend. Since I'm still learning Rust I'm doing it without AI agent. I have done rustlings and read books, done a little problem solving! To learn a language and tooling requires a significant project. So translating [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to Rust with the aid of vector libraries and actually just outputting it to the screen directly should be a suitable challenge. 

To run it just download it and: 
```bash 
cargo run
```
